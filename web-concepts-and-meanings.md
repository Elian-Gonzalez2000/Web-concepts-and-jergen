# Web Concepts and Meanings

- React server components: Server Components are a new type of Component that renders ahead of time, before bundling, in an environment separate from your client app or SSR server.

- Prop dilling: Props are passed to a component as a single object, and the component can then access each prop individually. This is called Prop Dilling.

- Streamming of HTML: The browser still open connection and when the serve get the infromation send it to the client. This used when the server sends the data to the client but when get the data from the server the browser will not wait for all responses to show information to the user.

- Dynamic rendering: The server can send the data to the client and the client can render the data without waiting for the server to send all the data.

- Routing based to file system: File-based routing is a way to configure your routes using the filesystem.

- Single page application (SPA): a website or web application that dynamically rewrites a current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.

- DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.

- Debounce in search: Is a delay between when the user is typing
